            <h3>2022/08</h3>
            <p class="change">This information was written before making my website. Changes that have been made to the design in production will be written in brown.</p>
            <p>
              In previous assignments, I always struggled to implement mobile
              versions and responsive design, because I never considered that
              when creative wireframes. So for this assignment, I went ahead and
              started with mobile versions of the website and then went on to
              create the desktop versions. 
            </p>
            <img
              class="design-sec"
              src="Images/Screen 1@1x (1).png"
              alt="Wireframe of the home page of this website"
            />
            <p>
              For data visualization, I've decided to use Adopt-a-pet's API and
              so my website needs to pull on viewer's heart strings. The home
              screen's background is of cuddling puppies, with a sad (true)
              statistic. I used an SVG for the logo so that it wouldn't change
              in quality if I resized it. I used a hamburger menu because I
              figured users would recognize it as opening a drop down menu.
            </p>
            <img
              class="design-sec-desk"
              src="Images/Screen 1@1x (2).png"
              alt="Wireframe of the home page of this website, for desktop"
            />
            <p>The desktop version was a little easier to design. The brown button at the top will take users to the Adopt-a-pet page where they can adopt a pet. Ultimately this site's purpose would be to lead people to that website, and encourage them to adopt a pet. Other than that - the page looks virtually the same.</p>
            <p class="change"> The home page didn't change much in production. I did opt not to include the adopt-a-pet button (basically because I don't have much time left and I'm prioritizing content)</p>
            <img 
            class="design-sec"
            src="Images/Screen2@1x (1).png" alt="Wireframe for the design section for this website">
            <p>The design section page was fairly easy to decide on - because there's really no way to get away with a bunch of text that has pictures scattered through it. I kept the same header from the home page, and I'm going to keep it on all the pages.</p>
            <img 
            class = "design-sec-desk" src="Images/Screen 2@1x.png" alt="Wireframe of the Design Section for the website, for desktop.">
            <p>The desktop version of the design section was definitely neater, and in my next iteration I definitely need to work on getting them both as neat as possible.</p>
            <p class="change">The design section probably changed the most. Again, I waited quite a while to get started and decided to repurpose some code I used for my first iteration of the last website. Overall, I think it was the right choice. It's neater, easier to read - and responsive. </p>
            <img 
            class="design-sec-desk"
            src="Images/Screen 3@1x (2).png" alt="Wireframe of the blog page for this website, for desktop">
            <p>Again, my blog versions look basically the same. I decided to have buttons that link to the blog posts, with dog and cat pictures (again, to trick people into adopting pets)</p>
            <p class="change"> The reason I changed the blog page was because I decided there was too big of a disconnect between the animal photos and my blog posts. Again, I used the repurposed code and I still think it's neater. </p>
            <img 
            class = "design-sec" 
            src="Images/Screen 3@1x (1).png" alt="Wireframe of the blog page for this website">
           <p>My colour palette was fairly easy to come up with - I knew my website would feature lots of dogs and cats, and I picked a standard colour that would be most likely to match any pictures of animals I decided to include. I picked a font that I thought was easy to read but in creating my actual website I will likely change the font to something easier to read and more professional. </p>
          <p class="change"> The font I used was mostly for professionalism. I also figured that for accessibility it would be best to go for a professional, neat, sans-serif font. </p>
