            <h1>Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation</h1>
            <h2>2022/09</h2>
            <p>
              Honestly, I haven’t finished this close reading. The reading
              itself is difficult to get through and particularly boring. I’m
              struggling to find meaning in the reading and therefore struggling
              to finish it. But it’s two days late and I can’t justify working
              on it anymore.
            </p>
            <h3>1.Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Not only is there no consensus on what interaction means, or it’s
              role of visualization, the notion of interaction has only recently
              been outlined for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and
              visualization researchers do not necessarily know how to apply the
              concepts of interaction in their own data- oriented practices.
              While interaction occurs at every stage of the visualization
              process, the community has paid less attention to the interaction
              aspect of the pipeline. This paper proposes crafting a definition
              for interaction for visualization, by combining researcher’s input
              and the view of interaction in the HCI community.
            </p>
            <h3>2.Research Metholodologies</h3>
            <p>
              The paper lists it’s research methodologies. Which include
              restrictions, expert papers, and stats.
            </p>
            <h3>3.The Visualization View of Interation.</h3>
            <p>
              This section of the paper defines the view of interaction in
              visualization based on 59 papers reviewed.
            </p>
            <h4>3.1. Definitions of Interaction for Visualization</h4>
            <p>
              The researchers considered the 32 papers with definitions, sorting
              them by whether they define interaction implicitly or explicitly.
            </p>
            <h5>3.1.1 What Interaction for Visualization must Involve</h5>
            <p>
              The definition papers imply the need for one entity (external),
              and two actions: external and internal.
            </p>
            <p>
              External Entities: User and data are the two most cited entities.
            </p>
            <p>
              External Actions: Interaction is described as “a dialogue between
              the user and the visualization system made of action-reaction
              pairs.” The user provides input and the system returns an output
              that is perceived by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internal Actions: Interaction requires the cognitive act of the
              user processing the data for themselves.
            </p>
            <h5>3.1.2 What Interaction for Visualization Can Involve</h5>
            <p>
              Interaction for visualization can involve additional external and
              internal entities, and additional external and internal actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              External Entities: Can involve physical objects such as mouse,
              pen, and a variety of body movements. Modalities such as gaze and
              body movements tend to be “overlooked”. Interaction involves the
              environment it takes place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internal Entities: User’s prior knowledge and skills are involved
              when interacting with a system. Interactions might occur without
              intent.
            </p>
            <p>
              External Actions: User actions can change data and the
              presentation of information. A user can also perform actions that
              do not affect the data visualization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internal Actions: Users can interact with data in their minds,
              including processing and reasoning.
            </p>
            <h5>3.1.3 Properties of Interaction</h5>
            <p>
              Interaction for visualization is goal-orientated, contains
              semantics and preserves the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              Granularity: Interaction contains multiple levels of granularity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuous vs. Discrete: Interactions can be continuous (happen
              over a span of time) and discrete (in which action and reaction
              occur in a distinct manner), interactions can have different
              continuity – a continuous action can have a discrete reaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Direct vs Indirect: Rather than think of interactions as direct or
              indirect, we should consider interactions to have varying degrees
              of direct or indirectness.
            </p>
            <h5>3.1.4. Terms Related to Interaction</h5>
            <p>
              Interaction, interaction techniques, interactivity, and science of
              interaction are distinct from each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              nteraction technique refers to the wats users can interact – in
              terms of hardware and software – it also does not imply intent.
              Interaction refers to the action-reaction between user and system,
              while Interactivity refers to the feel, properties, and quality of
              interaction. Science of Interaction is the study of
              knowledge-creating through interaction.
            </p>
            <h5>3.2. Reported Benefits and Critiques on Interaction</h5>
            <p>
              Interaction is seen as a way to allow users to be in control of
              information spaces, using interaction to learn, test and share
              information. Interaction helps make visualizations more
              accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frustrations around interaction: <br />
              - interaction is not often the focus of visualization research.
              <br />
              - interaction research focuses on implementation, not designing
              <br />
              - there is limited consideration for different forms of
              interaction compared to “classic desktop-mouse- keyboard setups”
              <br />
              - visualization systems are not flexible enough for users to do a
              considerable number of things surrounding the data – including
              organizing and annotating data.
              <br />
              - lack of flexibility is caused by technical challenges, costs,
              and lack of theoretical foundations.
