            <h2>Close reading of "Overview of Data Visualization." </h2>
            <h5>2022/08</h5>
            <p>
              2.1. The Concept of Data Visualization. <br />
              Data Visualization is regarded as “the science of visual
              representation of ‘data’” (Friendly, 2009, p. 2). <br />
              Traditional data visualisation focuses on communication for
              understanding data. <br />
              Advantages of traditional data visualization: <br />
              - Ability to represent a vast amount of data immediately <br />
              - Enables viewers to identify patterns immediately for forumalting
              ideas <br />
              - Can be used for product quality control, because immediate
              identification of problems is possible <br />
              - Enhances understanding of large-scale and small-scale data
              <br />
              - “data visualization assists in the constructing of hypotheses.”
              <br />
              Data visualization often results in graphical images which
              adssists in making decisions (Ware, 2012). <br />
              <br />
              2.1.1. The Definition of Data Visualization. <br />
              “Data Visualization can be defined in many ways - most definitions
              focus on the connection between data and computer technology in
              order to transform data into a visual or sonic form.” <br />
              Card, Mackinlay, and Schneiderman define it as “the use of
              computer-supported, interactive, visual representation of data to
              amplify cognition.” <br />
              Manovich defines it as “a transformation of quantified data which
              is not visual into visual representation? <br />
              Friendly (2009) defines it as “information which has been
              abstracted in some schematic form, including attributes or
              varibales for the units of information” <br />
              Kirk states that “data visualization involves an information
              exhange that includes the messenger, the receiver, and the
              message” and defines data visualization as “the representation and
              presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities
              in order to amplify cognition” <br />
              Bikakis defines data visualization as “the presentation of data in
              a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is
              the software that generates this presentation. Data visualization
              provides users with intuituve means to interactively explore and
              analyze daya, enabling them to effectively identify interesting
              patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and supports
              sense-making activities.” <br />
              <br />
              Data visualization involves four aspects: <br />
              - Real-time interaction (Bikakis - real-time interaction requires
              effecient and scalable techniques) <br />
              - On-the-fly processing (the support of on-the-fly visualizations
              over large and dynamic sets of volatile raw data - required)
              <br />
              - Visual scalability <br />
              - User assistance and personalization. <br />
              <br />
              A key feature of modern visualization is user comprehension and
              customization capabilies to various user-defined exploration
              scenarios and preferences. <br />
              Data vizualization can be categorized into two sub-fields: (Marai,
              2010; Post et al., 2003) <br />
              - Information visualization - is used to visually represent
              abstract data such as business data (Card, Mackinlay, &
              Schneiderman, 1999; Spence, 2007) <br />
              - Scientific visualization - is used to represent scientific data
              (Spence, 2007) <br />
              <br />
              Scientific and Information visualization focus on how to transform
              data into a visual form so that a user can read a graphical image
              and apprehend useful information. <br />
              <br />
              2.1.2. The Definition of Data and Information <br />
              I like the concept of data not having “meaning” because it means
              that in visualizing it, we are giving it meaning ourselves - which
              can tie in with what Hanli said in the lecture about “meaning
              making”. <br />
              In the reading, data is defined as “unprocessed information”,
              which is interesting because information is defined as “processed
              data” in information science. Information can be considered
              “useful data”. <br />
              <br />
              2.1.3. The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization <br />
              Forms of data representation are also called “visualization
              techniques”, which have been developed to optimize selecting and
              creating the most effective and efficient trandormation of data
              into information. <br />
              Visualization techniques are picked dependant on the type of data.
              <br />
              Data Visualization can be split into entities and relations (Ware,
              2012) in which entities refer to “visualizing objects”, while
              relations refer to “structures and patterns relevant to those
              entities”. <br />

              Data visualization (information design) aims to present all the
              objective data required to enable the users to make a decision.
              (Wildbur & Burke, 1998) <br />

              This is another concept that interests me, as I don’t know how I
              feel about “objective data” being used in this sentence. Of
              course, the data is completely objective but presenting it usually
              is not - and in fact, research tends not to be objective either.
              For example, studies that suggest the colour BLUE is evil, may
              have been paid for by the colour RED. And that “objective” data
              maybe shared, while other objective data (perhaps implying that
              all colours are equally evil) is conveniently not displayed.
              <br />
              Statistics and data visualization cannot always be described as
              “objective.” <br />
