            <h1>Blog 4: Critical Reflection - Your Data-Driven Artwork </h1>
            <h2>2022/</h2>
            <h3>
              2.1. The Concept of Data Visualization. </h3>
              <p>This critical reflection is significantly difficult because in my last assignment I hadn’t grasped the concept of data-driven art quite yet and didn’t include one – but I can now share what I have planned for my next submission, in the way of data driven art. </p> <p>
                First, I did some research on data-driven art and I had a really hard time trying to understand it beyond the concept of “pretty information” and what makes pretty information differs from person to person. I thought about art concepts I know and understand but I couldn’t find a way to control the composition of data, and even if I could, it felt wrong to twist data to fit my visual understanding of “pretty”.
             </p> <p>
                My website is about pets needing homes and I spent too much time thinking about how to make my data dog-shaped or home-shaped or bone-shaped, but I just couldn’t find a way to make it work. And, this is going to sound terrible, but all data is pretty to me – even if it isn’t meant to be. I’ve always liked graphs and (don’t laugh) even spent some time developing graphs to help me understand friendships and relationships – so the notion of some data visualization being prettier than others was a strange notion to me.
            </p> <p>
                I guess, in theory, every data visualization can be qualified as artwork – because someone has to decide the size of dots on a graph, the width of bars in histograms, and the colours of overlapping circles in a Venn diagram – in this way any data that is visualized is done so in an artistic manner. Data-driven art is the difference between a spreadsheet full of numbers and a visual representation that represents those numbers. I missed this point entirely for the majority of this semester and so I REALLY didn’t understand the concept of data-driven art. My analysis of every graph or Venn diagram concluded with “this is pretty because of the colours” when I should have been looking beyond “pretty”. Data-driven art is so meaningful because it’s not about being pretty – it’s about being functional. </p> 
            </p> 
            <p>
                Recently in my research – too late for the previous assignment and just in time for this one – I thought about looking at dog-specific data visualizations and found on that interested me on the website informationisbeautiful.net – I found a chart of dogs that are best in show vs which dogs are most often in show, which used pictures of the dog breeds rather than points on the map. I also found an amazing data-artwork called “Why do dogs and cats…?” that answers basically every dog/cat related question in a mind map. I also saw an incredibly interesting data artwork, which may be a little cliché, a portrait of animals that are going extinct – and the number of pixels is the number of that animal left.
             </p> <p>
                 This work struck me because it really showed how FEW there were left of each animal – and because I want my data to show how MANY animals there are in shelters, but the concept of pixels wouldn’t be effective enough in showing MANY animals. This is where the thought process really started.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Best In Show chart also helped me contextualize art in the context of data. The use of colour, size, which way the dog is facing, crossed with the shape of the dog breeds themselves made this a GREAT, and very FUNCTIONAL graph – which is what I was after. This graph is far more functional than the previous pixel art work, as that focuses more on guilting you.
            </p>

            <p>
                In way of showing how MANY animals were in shelters (note to self: the term pets without homes evokes a better response than animals in shelters) all I could think about was infographics that show silly things like “people who are killed by sharks vs people are killed by vending machines.” And I came up with a heart-wrenching idea. </p> <p> If I could use pictures of dogs/cats to show how many were in shelters (one svg image = 20 animals), I could also show how many of those dogs (statistically) are underweight, cold, afraid of thunderstorms or loud noises, and even how many have health issues. Statistically how many were abandoned or are going to be put down. I could do this using colours, that could change based on a button the user presses. In theory this is what it would look like:
            </p>
