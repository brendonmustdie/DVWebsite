                Introduction: </h3>
              <p>Kidd’s “Representation”, Viégas and Wattenberg’s “Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics”, and Sabine Roeser’s “How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflection on Risky Technologies” all touch on the idea of artistic intentions. </p> <p>
              Advantages of traditional data visualization: </p> <p>
                “Representation” focuses on how our art creates meaning, myth, and shapes our reality. “Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics” focuses on how art is used to display (and distort) data to show viewers a forced viewpoint. “How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflection on Risky Technologies” focuses on the combination of art and technology – and specifically the benefits of art that works with the intersection of humanity and technology. From this we can gather: artists can shape reality, through a distortion of data. This is the idea behind Data Visualisation and Data Art. 
            </p> <p>
                Focusing on how we represent data and information, we can force viewers to focus on what we want them to see, with artistic intention.  </p> 
              <br />
            </p> <h4>
                Kidd’s “Representation”: </h3>
            <p>
                Kidd’s book focuses on semiotics and the idea that representation in media is about creating meaning – but that perception becomes reality, and therefore that representation creates meaning in reality, not than just media. (Kidd, 2015) If representation changes reality, the choices we make when creating media have real-life implications and therefore: our choices matter. (Kidd, 2015) </p> <p>   Kidd discusses “Saussurean semiotics” and the concept that all words and signs are only understood by what they are not. For example: we only understand “dark” as “not light”, and vice versa. (Kidd, 2015) Kidd also discusses creating meaning as ‘active labour’ – we make meaning, we do not simply present what is inherently true. (Kidd, 2015) We create truth. 
            </p> <p>
                On a level of connotation, repurposed, existing symbols create myths about what they are representing. (Kidd, 2015) I.e.: the apple, an existing symbol, is repurposed to symbolize Apple, the brand, and represent Apple’s prowess – the representation of this prowess is a “myth”.  This ‘myth’ making indicates ideology creeping into media and normalize these ideologies. i.e.: the hero always being white is an extension of white supremacy. 
            </p> <p>
                Kidd’s opinion on infographics is relevant to Data Visualization. They are limited to minimalist images to represent concepts in order for their meaning to be instantly clear. Kidd discusses how the representation used in infographics can become persuasive - in this way, being intentional with meaning making we can manipulate viewers. (Kidd, 2015) One of the strategies of Data Visualization – and by extension, Data Art – is to manipulate viewers in it’s representation and meaning making. And, similarly to infographics (Data Art in it’s own right) it’s meant to convey information instantly. Data Visualization, at best, is intentional meaning making.  </p> <p>
                     Part of being aware of the meanings we are making, means focusing on which identities we are including, excluding, or misrepresenting. Nothing we make can be “non-political” because nothing can be “neutral or a-historical” even when it appears to be that way. (Kidd, 2015) My data visualizations are about dogs and their breeds, but the data connected with these breeds ignores the history of violence that are associated with dogs, especially in a racial context. It also acknowledges the life spans of these dogs without acknowledging the stereotypes associated with certain breeds that might affect the stats. I.E: Pitbulls are often considered violent and are more likely to be put down at an early age because of that violence, or outright abandoned, harmed, or killed. The stats shown on my page ignore that history – and show only their life expectancy without that context. Even though in theory this is neutral, I wittingly ignore this context when displaying the stats, because it’s easier to draw sympathy without acknowledging violence. 
                    Viégas and Wattenberg’s “Artistic Data Visualization
            </p>
            <h3>Viégas and Wattenberg’s “Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics”:</h3> 
            <p>
                Viégas and Wattenberg consider data visualization to have been, up until recently, a “scientific” analytical tool for sensemaking – which has been repurposed by artists to create pieces (data art). (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) Artists use familiar scientific visualization techniques, but their motives and creations are new and different. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) </p> <p>
             <p>Viégas and Wattenberg sidestep defining “art” in their definition of Data Art, by defining it as data visualizations done by artists, with artistic intentions. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) The intention is the most important part of this definition – it is not enough for the visualization to be “pretty”. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) In their discussion and conclusion, the researchers determine what distinguishes data visualizations from data art, after focusing on some examples: the data artworks embody a “forceful point of view” – artists ‘commit sins of visual analytics’ to derive their power and to guide viewers to understand an idea. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) Data artworks manipulate viewers into seeing what they are representing. </p>
              <p>Some of the data artworks use data but do not let the viewer draw any scientific conclusions, by preventing them from seeing the actual data – forcing them to focus on the overall image. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) By not expressly showing the data, artists can manipulate the viewer into seeing only specific aspects – images layered on top of each other allow viewers to see the most “common” poses of the era, rather than the actual body of each person in the images – in doing this, the artist creates (and points the viewer to) meaning from data. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007)</p>
             <p>Just as Kidd (Kidd, 2015)  states, Viégas and Wattenberg understand that it’s impossible to make a data visualization that is truly neutral – and that the power of artist’s visualizations is that they distort the data to their advantages. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007) Visualizations can be used to both persuade audiences and analyse data. Data art takes advantage of this fact. (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007)</p>
             <p>By distorting data, artists can “force” viewers to take note of what they want them to, in using data visualizations which have artistic intentions. </p>


             <h3>
                Sabine Roeser’s “How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflection on Risky Technologies”:</h3>
              <p>
                Mistrust of ‘risky’ technology often means that debates about technological developments become heated and end in stalemates. (Janssens, 2016) Roeser believes this indicates the need for other approaches to these debates, specifically involving arts and literature. (Janssens, 2016)  Roeser believes that techno-art can make debates and decisions around technological risks easier, leading to “morally better technological innovations.”  (Janssens, 2016)  She defines techno-art as “art the reflects on and engages with risky technologies”.  (Janssens, 2016) </p>
                <p>Roeser states the idea of art and literature having discussions around technological risks isn’t new: the genre of science fiction is built around different reactions to technological development: some utopian, and some dystopian. (Janssens, 2016)</p>
              <p>Techno-art approaches technology in ways that scientists never would by exploring conceptual issues – and encouraging critical thinking about the emotions evoked by artworks. (Janssens, 2016) Roeser discusses the idea that art helps our ethical and political thinking, and that works of techno-art could play a big role in debates around climate change by inciting people to take action. (Janssens, 2016)</p>
            <p>“Artists can play with the uncertainties and uneasy feelings by developing artworks” (Janssens, 2016)  and by “examining the boundaries between life and technology.” (Janssens, 2016)  Roeser believes artists should use technology in a restricted enough way to prevent harm, but in a more accessible setting than a lab – this is to help technology regulation, preventing the regulations from being put in place too late, or too early.  (Janssens, 2016)</p>
              
              <h3>
                Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>
                Data Visualization (and Data Art) represents data to create meaning. In creating this meaning, artists can manipulate viewers into understanding their viewpoint – sometimes by distorting the data visualizations or by showing viewers very specific forms of data in very specific ways. Data visualization is intentional (and manipulative) meaning making and shaping reality. </p><p>
                    Data artworks are made with the intention of showing viewers a very specific viewpoint, by manipulating the data, and the viewers. 
            </p><p>
                A huge part of web design, I’ve learned, is around the concept of manipulating the viewer. The term “manipulating” has it’s own bad connotations – but we, as web designers, “guide” viewers to what we need them to see. Through UI and UX design, we guide them to the pages we want them to visit most, we tell their eyes which order to read things in, we drag their eyes along the page, from component to component, in the order we want them to. And this is just a further extension of that. The easiest way to get viewers to believe you is to show them data – and you can manipulate data to show them whatever you want.  </p><p>

                    It's a power that comes with the responsibility of understanding that representation becomes reality.  </p><p>
